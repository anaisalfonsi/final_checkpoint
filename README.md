# W. is a blog/oracle card reading based on Travis Scott Universe. 

To me, he's the only artist that has made the idea of a circus "sexy". Also we share a lot of common interests : like eclectic music, astrology, strong colors, bling bling and we both have deep fascination for the cosmos.
Also, Travis has a lot of awesome gifs and photos. Which I find very fun to work with.

In conclusion, W. is a tribute to our crazy worlds, not so far from each other.
