# W.

Welcome! ^^

# W. is a blog /oracle card reading based on Travis Scott Artist Universe. 

To me, he's the only one that makes a circus "sexy". Also we share a lot of common interests : like eclectic music, astrology, strong colors, bling bling and we both have deep fascination for the cosmos.
Also, Travis has a lot of awesome gifs and photos. Which are really fun to work with.

In conclusion, W. is a tribute to our crazy worlds, not so far from each other.
